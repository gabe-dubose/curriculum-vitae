\textbf{Georgia Institute of Technology} \hfill January 2022 – December 2022 \\
\textbf{Principal Investigator}: Dr. William Ratcliff \\
\textbf{Synopsis}: During my master's, I focused on developing new bioinformatic and 
statistical approaches to analyze variants in population genomic data. 
Recent work has shown that many types of variants that were presumed neutral can have large effects. My focus has been developing statistical 
models that can account for this variability of mutational effects and developing accompanying bioinformatic tools that allow others to implement 
these approaches as well. My work in the Ratcliff lab has primarily focused on using yeasts (\emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}) to develop these approaches, 
with the intent that they will be applicable to other organisms as well. \\
\\
\textbf{Georgia Institute of Technology} \hfill August 2021 – April 2022 \\
\textbf{Principal Investigator}: Dr. Kostas Konstantinidis \\
\textbf{Synopsis}: In the Environmental Microbial Genomic Laboratory I combined transcriptomic and proteomic approaches to study the physiology of 
obligate halogen-respiring bacteria. These soil-dwelling bacteria subsist on a rather rare soil compound and grow significantly slower than other bacteria. 
My objective was to understand what physiological adaptations allow for this lifestyle. Additionally, such bacteria have been implied in bio-remediation 
efforts, as halogen pollutants pose large risks for the environment.\\

\noindent \textbf{University of Central Arkansas} \hfill January 2019 – April 2021\\
\textbf{Principal Investigator}: Dr. Tammy Haselkorn\\
\textbf{Thesis}: \emph{The Ecological and Evolutionary Dynamics of Social Amoeba Microbiomes and Key Symbionts} \\
\textbf{Synopsis}: As an undergraduate student I studied the symbiotic interaction between soil dwelling amoebae, their persistent bacterial symbionts, 
and their transient bacterial microbiota. My thesis work focused on understanding the key ecological drivers of these symbiotic interactions, 
including how various symbionts are transmitted, their relevance in shaping their host microbiota, and how abiotic soil factors influence the stability of their interactions. 
I have continued working with Dr. Haselkorn to study how abiotic and biotic soil factors influence amoeba-symbiont interactions and amoeba ecology in general. 
Recently, we have also started investigating how host genetics and diet contribute to shaping the gut microbiota of flies (\emph{Drosophila sp.}) 
that feed exclusively on cactus, aiming to gain a broader understanding of how host diet, genetics, and population structure influence their gut microbiota.\\

\textbf{Development of Programming Education Resources for Historically Minoritized Groups in Computing}\\
\textbf{Project Advisor}: Dr. Benjamin Rydal Shapiro \\
\textbf{Synopsis}: DataWorks is a data services provider that employs people from communities that have historically 
had little access to computational resources and education. By hiring and educating people from these groups, DataWorks
hopes to broaden access to computing and foster equitable labor practices. One of the main tasks performed by DataWorks employees 
is retrieving and organizing information from online locations, a process known as web scraping. I have been working with DataWorks 
on building educational resources that will teach the employees to how to automate these tasks using Python, as opposed to manual copying and pasting.
The primary resource is a comprehensive introductory Python course that is specifically designed for people with no computational experience. 
Since web scraping is the major task performed at DataWorks, this course teaches Python through the lens of parsing webpages into tabular data.
