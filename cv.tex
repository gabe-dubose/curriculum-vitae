{\Large Research Synopsis} \rule{16.51cm}{0.4pt}\\
\end{flushleft}
My primary research interest is in understanding the generation of biodiversity and biological complexity,
and I approach this through studying what facilitates and constrains evolutionary change. I have explored
this interest in several topics and model systems, but I mostly study life cycle evolution and the evolution 
of endosymbiotic interactions. I predominately approach my work on life cycle evolution from an 
evolutionary genetics and organismal perspective, while I predominately approach my work the evolution
of endosymbioses from an ecological perspective. In addition to my core research, I am also interested in 
developing computational and statistical approaches for improving inferences regarding evolutionary patterns 
and processes.

\textbf{US Fish and Wildlife Service Monarch Butterfly Festival}\\
Each year, the US Fish and Wildlife Service hosts an education-oriented festival in St. Marks, Florida, where
monarchs are captured and tagged for research purposes. Each year, the de Roode lab participates with our own 
educational booth where we discuss and screen for monarch parasites with the general public. \\
\\
\textbf{Rosalynn Carter Butterfly Trail}\\
The Rosalynn Cater Butterfly Trail is a program that aims to increase habitat for native pollinators. I am frequently
invovled in various programs and events organized by the Rosalynn Cater Butterfly Trail, including their annual Spring
symposium that is focused on communicating best practices in pollinator habitat construction, as well as various projects
that involve planting said habitats. \\
\\
\textbf{Programming Education Resources for Historically Minoritized Groups in Computing}\\
In collaboration with DataWorks, a data service provider that employs people from communities that have historically 
had less access to computational resources and education, I developed and taught an introductory Python course that was specifically
designed for people with no prior computational experience.
